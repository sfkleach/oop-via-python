Advert for Session 02
> Just a reminder that this Wednesday I will be running Part 2 of a series of workshops on the Tao of object-oriented programming using Python as our tutorial vehicle. If you missed Part 1, don't worry, I am doing a short recap each week that doubles up as refresher for those who attended and intro for new joiners.
> 
> The first sessions are based on a running example that you can find at rosettacode.org. This Wednesday's session will be focussed on the nature of extensibility. It will starts from the conventional basis of class extension and sneakily slinks sideways into a strange new perspective. You may never see code the same way again :scream:.
> 
> All the resources for the sessions are available on github and if there's sufficient interest I am planning on a further 6 workshops.

Alternative advert:
> Coming up this Wednesday is my second session on the Tao of object-oriented programming, integrated into our Python workshops. This is aimed at folk who know some Python but who want the why of OOP. Why use it? Why not use it? Why is it so successful? What's wrong with it? What makes sense and what is nonsense?
