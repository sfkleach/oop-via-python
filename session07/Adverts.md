# Advert for Session 07

# Python Labs channel

Happy New Year everyone! I hope that some of you have had a go at refactoring 
[Floyd-Warshall](https://github.com/sfkleach/oop-via-python/blob/main/session06/floyd_warshall.py)
over the holiday break. If not you still have time to get cracking 
:firecracker::firecracker::firecracker:. In the meantime I am busy writing the 
text for our thrilling next episode, where our heroes, having been driven off 
the Forest Path that supposedly guaranteed their safety, unexpectedly find an 
old crumbling building, a church perhaps, from which a single light glows .... 
will they discover a tunnel leading to an underground rave where a thunderous 
beat makes coherent thought impossible as annoyingly attractive dancers cavort 
around them?

It seems unlikely because the next session (#07, Wednesday the 12th January 
will be on the interlinked concepts of encapulation, ownership and part-of! Yes!! 
The workshop we have been waiting for, where subtle layered concepts are 
deconstructed before your very eyes!!

Hope to see you there!

# CodeHub General channel, 11th Jan 2022
I will be running the 7th session of the mini-series OOP via Python, tomorrow, on Wednesday the 12th Jan at Workshop Wednesday.  This week's session will be following the AGM, which means it will be short and sweet. And that's a good thing because this week we'll be exploring the horror genre ...

This session starts with a seemingly innocent example, a simple and elegant program, that quickly turns into a ghastly nightmare. What foul play is afoot? Luckily we will discover a couple of trick endings that allow us to escape the consequences of our reckless optimism and, in the process, reveal the true notion of encapsulation. From dark to light, as it were.

See you there!
