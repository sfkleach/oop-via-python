# Advert for Session 07

Happy New Year everyone! I hope that some of you have had a go at refactoring 
[Floyd-Warshall](https://github.com/sfkleach/oop-via-python/blob/main/session06/floyd_warshall.py)
over the holiday break. If not you still have time to get cracking 
:firecracker::firecracker::firecracker:. In the meantime I am busy writing the 
text for our thrilling next episode, where our heroes, having been driven off 
the Forest Path that supposedly guaranteed their safety, unexpectedly find an 
old crumbling building, a church perhaps, from which a single light glows .... 
will they discover a tunnel leading to an underground rave where a thunderous 
beat makes coherent thought impossible as annoyingly attractive dancers cavort 
around them?

It seems unlikely because the next session (#07, Wednesday the 12th January 
will be on the interlinked concepts of encapulation, ownership and part-of! Yes!! 
The workshop we have been waiting for, where subtle layered concepts are 
deconstructed before your very eyes!!

Hope to see you there!
