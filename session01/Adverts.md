Advert for Session 01

> I will be running a series of about half-a-dozen, short workshops under the heading of "Using Classes in Python" in the PyLab sessions - starting tomorrow. It's aimed at people who have had a bit of experience in programming in Python and are looking for the spark that can jump the gap and brings object-oriented programming to life.
> 
> I wanted to run them because a theme that I hear from people is that they don't get what classes are for in Python. Sure, they've read on forums that classes are supposed to be important but that's just empty words. Maybe they have done a few exercises, know the syntax, but - pffft - what's the point?
> 
> In these workshops, we'll be using Python to get under the skin of object oriented programming. The focus won't be on the mechanics of writing code, there's a wealth of on-line material that does that. Our destination is a proper understanding of why OOP has become so dominant, to develop a sixth-sense to 'see' the classes hidden inside procedural programs, and to reach a next-level grasp of encapsulation ... either that or a glorious failure!
