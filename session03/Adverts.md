# Advert for Session 03

Session 03 is carefully designed to erode your sense of reality. You will enter thinking that you get the whole object-and-methods schtick and leave the session suddenly aware that that innocent looking code is really a fake world of constantly shifting shadows and gruesome dopplegangers ..... only with tea and cake at break times and disappointingly less actual drama.

In Session 03 we will explore how methods that change state (mutators) can turn on and off other methods, what that means for safe programming, the different recipes that various ~~snake-oil salesmen~~ gurus have recommended for taming the chaos, and from there lay one of the central foundations for genuine mastery of object oriented programming.

(P.S. Bring your own tea and cake. My transporter beam is on the blink again.)
