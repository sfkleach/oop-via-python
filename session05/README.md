# X-Ray Vision

## Steps

# Running the live demonstrations 

1. make clean
2. make start
3. Open Terminal.app and Setup virtual environment with ". venv/bin/activate"
4. Create a new transient branch (spike/session05?)
5. Transform range_extract.py, checking using pytest test_range_extract.py
6. Transform knights_tour.py, checking using pytest test_knights_tour.py
7. Reset the branch back to master!

## Situations

- Convert generic structures into object, replacing direct access with (core) methods
- Extract method (refactoring) and then shift them to a better class
- Gather buddy variables into new classes
- Collate function parameters into parameter-object
- Converting switches into method dispatch
- Convert entire functions into objects + series of calls
